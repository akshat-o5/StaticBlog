# Introduction to React Hooks

React Hooks have revolutionized the way we manage state and side effects in React functional components. Since their introduction in React 16.8, they have become an essential part of modern React development. In this article, we'll explore what React Hooks are, why they are important, and how to use them effectively.

## What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are functions that allow functional components to manage state and perform side effects. They enable developers to use stateful logic in functional components without converting them to class components. React Hooks come with a set of built-in hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer, among others.

## Why React Hooks?

Prior to React Hooks, managing state and side effects in functional components was cumbersome. Developers had to use Higher Order Components (HOCs) or render props to share stateful logic between components. With React Hooks, we can encapsulate logic within the component itself, leading to cleaner and more modular code.

## Basic React Hooks

### useState

useState is a Hook that allows functional components to manage state. It returns a stateful value and a function to update that value. Here's an example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                Click me
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}
```



# useEffect

`useEffect` is a Hook that performs side effects in functional components. It runs after every render and replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. Here's an example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
    });

    return (
        <div>
            <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                Click me
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}
```


## Additional React Hooks

React Hooks offer a variety of additional hooks for different use cases:

- `useContext`: For accessing React context in functional components.
- `useReducer`: For managing complex state logic.
- `useRef`: For accessing DOM elements and storing mutable values.

## Conclusion

React Hooks have simplified state management and side effects in React functional components. They provide a cleaner and more concise way to write components, making React development more efficient and enjoyable. As you explore React Hooks further, you'll discover their versatility and power in building modern React applications.
